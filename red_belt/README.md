# About  

This course builds upon the "Fundamentals of C++ Development: The Yellow Belt" course and focuses on teaching effective C++ coding. It also covers some additional C++ features not covered in previous courses, including:

* macros
* class templates
* code optimization principles
* efficient use of input/output threads
* algorithm complexity estimation
* the C++ memory model
* effective use of linear containers (vector, deque, list, string)
* move semantics
* an introduction to multi-threaded programming.

In addition, the course demonstrates how to create your own profiler using White, Yellow, and Red Belt knowledge. As with previous courses, a final project awaits you at the end. In this case, you will be tasked with creating your own search engine.
