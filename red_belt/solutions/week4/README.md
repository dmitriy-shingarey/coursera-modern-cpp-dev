## [Programming Practice Assignment: Athletes](1_athletes)

Condition

Each athlete has a unique number written on his jersey. Athletes take turns coming out of the locker room and must line up at the stadium. The coach calls the number of the athlete in front of whom to stand. If the athlete with the named number is not on the field, then it is necessary to stand at the end of the line.

In the standard input, first a natural number n, not exceeding 100000, is given - the number of athletes. Then there are n pairs of non-negative integers not exceeding 100000. The first number in the pair is the number of the next exiting athlete. The second number in the pair is the number of the athlete in front of whom the current athlete should stand.

Type in the standard output the numbers of the athletes in the order of formation on the field.

The time limit is 0.8 s.
