![][def_logo]  

This repository contains materials and assignments on the [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-plus-plus-modern-development) from Yandex and MIPT on Coursera "The Art of Development in Modern C++".  

In the specialization, instructors share their years of experience in creating large projects in C++. They don't retell the textbook, but teach how to solve   problems that most developers face in practice. Lectures given in an easy and accessible form, supported by a large number of tasks on programming. After  finishing this specialization you'll be able not only to talk about C++, comparing it with other languages, but also get a real programming skill.  

The specialization consists of 5 courses:  
    1. [C++ Development Essentials: white belt](https://github.com/dmitriy-shingarey/coursera-modern-cpp-dev/tree/white_belt/white_belt)  
    2. [C++ Development Essentials: yellow belt](yellow_belt)  
    3. C++ Development Essentials: red belt  
    4. C++ Development Essentials: brown belt  
    5. C++ Development Essentials: black belt  

White and Yellow Belt courses were moved from [Gitlab-repo1](https://gitlab.com/Shingarey/coursera_yandex_cpp) and [Gitlab-repo2](https://gitlab.com/Shingarey/yandex_cpp).
