# Specialization: The Art of Developing in Modern C++

![logo][def_logo]  

This repository contains materials and assignments on the [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-plus-plus-modern-development) from Yandex and MIPT on Coursera "The Art of Development in Modern C++". __Consider that the course has been suspended ([more](https://blog.coursera.org/coursera-response-to-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-ukraine?utm_source=marketing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=12245&sfmc_id=6081901&sfmc_key=0031U00001Pzd3UQAR))__.

In this specialization, instructors share their extensive experience developing large projects in C++. Rather than simply reciting a textbook, they teach how to tackle the types of problems that most developers encounter in practice. The lectures, which are presented in an easy-to-follow style, are supplemented with a large number of programming exercises. Upon completing this specialization, you will not only be able to compare C++ to other languages, but you will also have gained practical programming skills.

Upon completing our specialization, students should be able to:

* effectively solve practical problems in C++
* utilize C++ idioms and constructs such as STL, RAII, const-correctness, and type-safety
* independently find answers to questions and further their knowledge of the language
* write efficient C++ code without sacrificing readibility and maintainability.

The specialization consists of 5 courses:  

## [1. C++ Development Essentials: white belt](https://github.com/dmitriy-shingarey/coursera-modern-cpp-dev/tree/white_belt/white_belt)

This course introduces the C++ programming language. You will learn how to utilize its fundamental structures, create custom data types, and organize your program into classes and functions. Upon completion of the course, you will have the skills to complete a final project: implementing a basic data warehouse with the ability to add, delete, and search data.  

## [2. C++ Development Essentials: yellow belt](yellow_belt)

This course covers topics including:

* integer types in C++
* pairs and tuples
* function templates
* inheritance and polymorphism
* iterators and standard algorithms
* separating code into multiple files

Additionally, the course covers the use of unit tests for debugging and improving code reliability, and demonstrates how to create your own unit test framework using only White and Yellow Belt knowledge. Similar to the White Belt course, you will also complete a final project at the end of the Yellow Belt course. In the White Belt, you implemented a simple data warehouse with add, delete, and search capabilities. For the Yellow Belt, you will build upon this repository by adding support for more complex queries.

## [3. C++ Development Essentials: red belt](red_belt)

This course builds upon the "Fundamentals of C++ Development: The Yellow Belt" course and focuses on teaching effective C++ coding. It also covers some additional C++ features not covered in previous courses, including:

* macros
* class templates
* code optimization principles
* efficient use of input/output threads
* algorithm complexity estimation
* the C++ memory model
* effective use of linear containers (vector, deque, list, string)
* move semantics
* an introduction to multi-threaded programming.

In addition, the course demonstrates how to create your own profiler using White, Yellow, and Red Belt knowledge. As with previous courses, a final project awaits you at the end. In this case, you will be tasked with creating your own search engine.

## 4. C++ Development Essentials: brown belt  

The primary focus of this course is to teach C++ idioms, or how to utilize the language's various features to create efficient, reliable, and easy-to-maintain blocks of code. When paired with the knowledge gained from the Red Belt course, this will enable you to not only write efficient programs, but also maintainable ones. We will also cover topics that were not covered in previous courses, including namespaces and effective use of associative containers.

## 5. C++ Development Essentials: black belt  

The Black Belt course will cover essential topics for a complete understanding of C++, such as virtual method tables, virtual destructors, undefined behavior, templates with an arbitrary number of arguments, and forwarding links. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to work with libraries and tools commonly used in modern C++ development, such as sanitizers and protobuf. The course will also include a large project, which will take three weeks to complete instead of the usual one week.
