# About  

This course is about getting to know the C++ programming language. You will learn how to use its basic constructions, create your own data types, and divide the program into classes and functions.  
At the end of the course you'll get a final project: you'll be able to implement a simple data warehouse with addition, deletion and search capabilities.
