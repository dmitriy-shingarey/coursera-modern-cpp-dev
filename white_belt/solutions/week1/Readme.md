# Week1. Introduction to the Art of C++

## [Programming Assignment: A + B](01_a_plus_b)

Two integer numbers are passed to the program through standard input, not exceeding the modulus of 100000. Output their sum to standard output.

## [Programming Assignment: Minimum String](02_min_string)

In the standard stream, three strings are given, separated by a space. Each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length of no more than 30 characters. Output the lexicographically minimal one to the standard output.

## [Programming Assignment: Equation](03_quadratic_equation)

The real coefficients A, B, and C of the equation AxÂ² + Bx + C = 0 are input to your program in the standard input stream. Output all its different real roots to the output stream in any order, separating the roots with spaces. It is guaranteed that at least one of the equation coefficients is not equal to zero.

## [Programming Assignment: Division](04_division)

Given two integers A and B in the range from 0 to 1,000,000 inclusive, write a program that calculates the integer part of the division of A by B. If B is 0, output "Impossible".

## [Programming Assignment: Calculating the Cost of a Product](05_product_price)

Write a program to calculate the cost of purchasing a product with a discount. If the original cost of the product is more than A rubles, a discount of X percent is applied to it. If the original cost of the product is more than B rubles, a discount of Y percent is applied to it.
On the input, the program is given five real numbers: N, A, B, X, Y (A < B) - where N is the original cost of the product. Output the cost of purchasing the product with the discount applied.

## [Programming Assignment: Even Numbers](06_even_numbers)

Given two integers A and B (A <= B, A >= 1, B <= 30000), output all even numbers from A to B (inclusive) through a space.

## [Programming Assignment: Second Occurrence](07_second_appearance)

Given a string. Find the second occurrence of the letter 'f' in this string and output the index of this occurrence. If the letter 'f' occurs only once in the string, output -1, and if it does not occur at all, output -2. The indexes are numbered starting from zero.

## [Programming Assignment: Greatest Common Divisor](08_greatest_common_devisor)

Given two natural numbers in stdin. Output their greatest common divisor in stdout.

## [Programming Assignment: Binary Numbers](08_greatest_common_devisor)

Given a positive integer N. Output it in binary form without leading zeros.
