# Programming Task: First Names and Last Names - 2

    Complete the class from the previous task "First and Last Names - 1" with the method GetFullNameWithHistory:

    Unlike the GetFullName method, the GetFullNameWithHistory method should return not only the first and last names by the end of a given year, but also all previous first and last names  names in reverse chronological order. If the actual facts show that  the person has changed their first or last name to the same first or last name twice in a row, the second change  should be ignored when building the history.

    For a better understanding of the format, see the examples.
