# Programming Assignment: Queue

  People stand in a queue, but they never leave the beginning of the queue, but they can come to the end
  and go from there. Moreover, sometimes some people may stop and start
  worry because the queue isn't moving forward.

  Implement the processing of the following operations on the queue:

* WORRY i: mark the i-th person from the beginning of the queue (numbered from 0) as a worrier;
* QUIET i: mark the i-th person as calm;
* COME k: add k calm people to the end of the queue;
* COME -k: remove k people from the end of the queue;
* WORRY_COUNT: find out the number of worried people in the queue.

  Initially the queue is empty.
