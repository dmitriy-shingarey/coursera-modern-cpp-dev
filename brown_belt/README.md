# About 

The primary focus of this course is to teach C++ idioms, or how to utilize the language's various features to create efficient, reliable, and easy-to-maintain blocks of code. When paired with the knowledge gained from the Red Belt course, this will enable you to not only write efficient programs, but also maintainable ones. We will also cover topics that were not covered in previous courses, including namespaces and effective use of associative containers.
