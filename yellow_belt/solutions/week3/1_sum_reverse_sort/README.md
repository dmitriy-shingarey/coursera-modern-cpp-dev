# Programming assignment: Implement the functions declared in the header file

You are given the header file sum_reverse_sort.h, which contains the declarations of three functions

    #pragma once
    # include <string>
    # include <vector>

    using namespace std;

    int Sum(int x, int y);
    string Reverse(string s);
    void Sort(vector<int>& nums);

You need to send a cpp file containing the definitions of these functions.
