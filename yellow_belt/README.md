# About  

This course is a continuation of the course [C++ Development Essentials: white belt](https://github.com/dmitriy-shingarey/coursera-modern-cpp-dev/tree/white_belt/white_belt). It continues to introduce you to the capabilities of the C++ language. The course covers:

- integer types in C++
- pairs and tuples
- function templates
- inheritance and polymorphism
- iterators and standard algorithms
- code distribution into several files

In addition, the course deals with the use of unit tests for debugging programs and code reliability, and demonstrates how to develop your own unit test framework using only the knowledge of the White and Yellow Belts.

Just like the White Belt, you'll also get a final project at the end of the course. In the White Belt, you had to implement a simple data warehouse with the ability to add, delete and search. In the Yellow Belt, this repository will need to be improved by adding support for more complex queries.
